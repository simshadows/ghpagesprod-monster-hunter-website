# Important TODOs

- I haven't actually run the elemental/status formula through anybody yet. I'll need to get that off someone who's done the research.

- If I implement calculations involving MV's, I'll need to remember that Silkbind attacks can be treated differently to other attacks, such as with Critical Draw and Punishing Draw.

- Heroics has `defense-increasing effects are negated`. What does this mean?

- I assume applying, say, `Use Para Coating I` and `Use Para Coating II` on the same bow at the same time will apply the highest compatibility state. Also, applying `Use Para Coating II` to two slots at once will not reapply the raw penalty (or raw bonus for others). Not very meaningful to be pedantic about it, but I want the builder to be accurate, so I'll double-check later.
